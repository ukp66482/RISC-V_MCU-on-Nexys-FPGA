# JTAG Debug Mode — Vitis Unified IDE

This guide walks through loading and debugging a MicroBlaze RISC-V application over JTAG using the **AMD Vitis Unified IDE**.

## Prerequisites

- A hardware design exported as an `.xsa` file from Vivado
- Vitis Unified IDE installed
- Cmod A7-35T board connected to the host via USB

---

## 1. Open Vitis Workspace

Launch the Vitis Unified IDE. On the Welcome page, click **Open Workspace** to select or create a working directory.

## 2. Create a Platform

### 2.1 New Platform Component

From the menu bar, select **File > New > Platform** to create a new platform component.

![File > New > Platform](images/image_1.png)

### 2.2 Name and Location

On the **Name and Location** page:

- **Component name**: enter `platform`
- **Component location**: choose your workspace directory

Click **Next** to continue.

### 2.3 Select Hardware Design (XSA)

On the **Flow** page:

- Select **Hardware Design**
- In the **Hardware Design (XSA) For Implementation** field, browse to the `.xsa` file exported from Vivado

Wait for the tool to create the System Device Tree and retrieve processor details.

### 2.4 Select Operating System and Processor

On the **OS and Processor** page:

- **Operating system**: `standalone`
- **Processor**: `microblaze_riscv_0`

Click **Next** to finish.

### 2.5 Platform Created

Once created, Vitis displays the platform's Domain settings where you can verify the processor and configuration.

## 3. Create an Application

### 3.1 Create from Template

In the left-side template list, select **Hello World**, then click **Create Application Component from Template**.

![Select Hello World Template](images/image_6.png)

### 3.2 Set Application Name

On the **Name and Location** page:

- **Component name**: enter your application name (e.g. `GPIO_test`)

Click **Next** to continue.

![Set Application Name](images/image_7.png)

### 3.3 Select Platform

On the **Hardware** page, select the previously created **platform** (Board: `cmod_a7-35t`).

Click **Next** to continue.

![Select Platform](images/image_8.png)

### 3.4 Review Summary and Finish

Review the application settings:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | GPIO_test |
| Platform | platform |
| Domain | standalone_microblaze_riscv_0 (OS:standalone, Processor:microblaze_riscv_0) |

Click **Finish** to create the application.

## 4. Write Application Code

### 4.1 Default Source Code

After creation, a default `helloworld.c` file is placed in the `src` directory. You can modify this file directly or add your own source files.

![Default Source Code](images/image_10.png)

### 4.2 Add Source Files

Add your source files under the `src` directory (e.g. `gpio_init.c`).

![Add Source Files](images/image_11.png)

### 4.3 Configure Compile Sources

Open **UserConfig.cmake** and go to the **Sources > Compile sources** section to add the new source files to the build:

1. Click **Browse** to select files
2. Verify the file appears in the list
3. Use **Delete** to remove unwanted entries

![Configure Compile Sources - 2](images/image_13.png)

---

## 5. Configure the Linker Script

### 5.1 Memory Region Settings

Open the **Linker Script** settings page to adjust:

- **Available Memory Regions**: view available regions (e.g. Local Memory)
- **Stack Size**: set the stack size
- **Heap Size**: set the heap size

![Linker Script Settings](images/image_14.png)

### 5.2 Section to Memory Region Mapping

Verify that each section (`.text`, `.data`, `.bss`, `.stack`, `.heap`, etc.) is mapped to the correct memory region.

---

## 6. Configure Platform BSP

Open the platform's **Configuration for Os: standalone** settings page and verify the following key parameters:

- **stdin** and **stdout**: set to the appropriate UART peripheral (e.g. `axi_uartlite_0`)
- Adjust other BSP settings as needed

---

## 7. Build

### 7.1 Build the Platform

In the **FLOW** panel at the bottom-left, select the **platform** component and click **Build**.

Wait for the build to complete — confirm the log shows `Platform Build Finished Successfully`.

![Build Platform](images/image_17.png)

### 7.2 Build the Application

Switch to the application component (e.g. `GPIO_test`) and click **Build**.

Verify the build succeeds and produces the `.elf` file.

## 8. Run and Debug over JTAG

### 8.1 Run the Application

Before debugging, you can first run the application to verify it works correctly. In the **FLOW** panel, click **Run**.

Vitis will automatically:
1. Download the bitstream to the FPGA via JTAG
2. Load the `.elf` into the MicroBlaze RISC-V processor
3. Execute the program from start to finish

This lets you confirm the application runs as expected before entering a debug session.

![Run Application](images/image_19.png)

### 8.2 Start a Debug Session

Once the application is verified, click **Debug** in the **FLOW** panel to launch a debug session. This works similarly to GDB — the program is loaded and paused at `main()`, allowing you to inspect and step through the code interactively.

![Start Debug](images/image_20.png)

### 8.3 Debug Controls

In the Debug view, the left panel provides:

- **THREADS**: thread information
- **CALL STACK**: call stack trace
- **VARIABLES**: variable inspection
- **WATCH**: watch expressions
- **BREAKPOINTS**: breakpoint management

The toolbar at the top provides **Continue**, **Step Over**, **Step Into**, **Step Out**, and other debug controls.

![Debug View](images/image_21.png)

### 8.4 Breakpoints and Stepping

Click in the gutter area next to a line number to set a breakpoint. Use Step Over / Step Into to step through the code line by line.

## 9. Advanced Inspection Tools

### 9.1 Open the Register Inspector

From the menu, select **View > Register Inspector** to open the register inspection panel.

![Open Register Inspector](images/image_22.png)

### 9.2 View Register Contents

The Register Inspector displays all processor registers and their current values, including:

- General-purpose registers (x0 – x31)
- Program Counter (PC)
- HEX values and descriptions for each register

![Register Inspector](images/image_23.png)

### 9.3 View Memory Contents

Open the **Memory Inspector** panel to:

- Enter a memory address (e.g. `0x60000000`) to inspect a specific memory region
- View data in hexadecimal format
- Monitor memory changes in real time
